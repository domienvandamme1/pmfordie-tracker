Product Requirements Document (PRD)
1. Overview
Project Name: HTML Calendar Page

Purpose:
Create a simple HTML page that displays one box per day. These boxes are grouped into rows, each containing 14 days. The page visually distinguishes days that have passed from those that have not by using color-coding.

Key Dates:

Today’s Date: February 27, 2025
Last Day to Display: December 31, 2025 (Assuming “31 dev 2025” is equivalent to December 31, 2025)
2. Objectives
Daily Box Display: Each day between February 27, 2025, and December 31, 2025, will have its own box.
Grouping: Boxes will be grouped in rows of 14 days.
Color Coding:
Red Box: Indicates that the day has passed (i.e., any day before February 27, 2025).
Green Box: Indicates that the day has not yet passed (i.e., February 27, 2025, and any day after).
3. Functional Requirements
3.1 Daily Box Generation
Display Range:
Generate a box for each day starting from February 27, 2025, to December 31, 2025.
Box Content:
Each box should display the date (e.g., “Feb 27, 2025”).
3.2 Grouping Boxes
Grouping Rule:
Arrange the boxes in groups (or rows) of 14 boxes.
Layout Consideration:
Use responsive design principles to ensure that the groups display correctly on different screen sizes.
3.3 Color Coding Logic
Past Days:
If a day is before the current day (February 27, 2025), the box should have a red background.
Future Days (Including Today):
If a day is on or after February 27, 2025, the box should have a green background.
Dynamic Behavior (Optional):
Consider using JavaScript so that the page can dynamically calculate and update the colors based on the user’s current date if needed.
4. Non-functional Requirements
4.1 Performance
The page should load quickly, even when generating a large number of boxes.
4.2 Usability
The layout should be clear and intuitive, allowing users to easily distinguish between passed and upcoming days.
4.3 Compatibility
The HTML page should be compatible with modern web browsers.
Use responsive design practices so the calendar is viewable on both desktop and mobile devices.
4.4 Maintainability
Code should be well-commented and structured.
Use external CSS and JavaScript files to facilitate easier updates and maintenance.
5. Technical Approach
5.1 Technology Stack
HTML5: For page structure.
CSS3: For styling the boxes (colors, layout, responsiveness).
JavaScript: For:
Generating the day boxes dynamically.
Implementing the color coding logic based on date comparisons.
5.2 Implementation Details
HTML Structure:
Use a container element (e.g., <div class="calendar-container">) that holds all the day boxes.
Each day box can be a <div class="day-box"> element displaying the date.
CSS Styling:
Define styles for .day-box with fixed dimensions, margins, and text alignment.
Create classes such as .past (red background) and .upcoming (green background) to apply the appropriate colors.
JavaScript Logic:
Calculate the total number of days between February 27, 2025, and December 31, 2025.
Loop through each day, create a corresponding box, and determine the background color by comparing the day’s date to the current date.
Insert a container element or use CSS grid/flexbox to group boxes into rows of 14.
6. Acceptance Criteria
Functional Verification:

The HTML page renders one box per day from February 27, 2025, to December 31, 2025.
Boxes are clearly grouped into rows, with 14 boxes per row.
Days prior to February 27, 2025, display a red background; days on or after display a green background.
User Interface:

The page is responsive and looks correct on both desktop and mobile devices.
The layout is clean, and the date information in each box is legible.
Performance and Compatibility:

The page loads within acceptable time limits.
The page functions correctly across major modern web browsers
